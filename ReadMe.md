# SnapKit
SnapKit is a Java UI kit. Why do we need another UI kit? Because JavaFX is missing many great things about Swing, and vice versa.

What's to love about Swing?

	- The full set of geometric shape primitives: Rect, Ellipse, Path, Polygon, etc.
	- Easily set border, background, font on any component with simple API
	- The whole convenient painting model - just override paint() and customize
	- It handles property changes in the conventional Java property change manner
	- It binds easily with POJOs

What's to love about JavaFX?

	- Easily mix graphics and app controls
	- Easily add gradients, textures, effects
	- Set arbitrary transforms (rotate, scale, skew) on any node
	- It has a full set of nodes for easy layout: Box, BorderView, StackPane, etc.
	- It has support for easily defining UI in a separate text file (FXML)

What's to love about SnapKit? It provides all these features and more with a clean and simple API that can run on top of either Swing or JavaFX. And that's just for starters - SnapKit has many other design benefits.
